# Fallout 2 Adjustments

The mod is available to anyone, but it is not meant as a public release and might not adhere to the standards of one. It's something I wrote and used for myself in my own playthroughs.

This is a collection of minimalistic mods that aim to keep the game largely vanilla and either:

1. Fix game imbalances.
2. Add quality of life features.
3. Put optional restrictions on the player for a more challenging playthrough.

The mod is fully modular. Each component can be disabled in the `.ini` file.
